<body>
 <div id="page-container">
   <div id="content-wrap">
     <!-- all other page content -->
     So what is this doing?

    The page-container goes around everything on the page, and sets its minimum height to 100% of the viewport height (vh). As it is relative, its child elements can be set with absolute position based on it later.
    The content-wrap has a bottom padding that is the height of the footer, ensuring that exactly enough space is left for the footer inside the container they are both in. A wrapping div is used here that would contain all other page content.
    The footer is set to absolute, sticking to the bottom: 0 of the page-container it is within. This is important, as it is not absolute to the viewport, but will move down if the page-container is taller than the viewport. As stated, its height, arbitrarily set to 2.5rem here, is used in the content-wrap above it.
    And there you have it. Your footer now stays where you would expect!

    Final touches
    Of course, this is CSS, so it wouldn‚Äôt be complete without some mobile-specific UX considerations, and an alternative approach using min-height: 100% rather than 100vh. But this has its own drawbacks.

    If you are comfortable using Flexbox there is also a great suggestion of using flex-grow in the comments, which I recommend.

    Which method you choose is entirely up to you, and the specifics of your design. Hopefully, the above example and links help you save some time in making your decision and implementing it. üòÅ
